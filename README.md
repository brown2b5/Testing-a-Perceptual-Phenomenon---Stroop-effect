# Testing a Perceptual Phenomenon - Stroop effect

In a Stroop task (1), participants are shown words with differing colors of ink and the time it takes the participant to state the color of the ink is recorded.  This happens under two different conditons.  The congruent condition for which the colored words match the ink for which they are printed.  The incongruent condition for which the colored words do not match the ink for which they are printed.  The purpose of this project is to examine some descriptive statistics regarding the time it takes for participants to state the color of the ink correctly under each of the conditions and to see if there is a significant difference between the mean times for each of the two conditions.
